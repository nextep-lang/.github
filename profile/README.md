# Welcome to the NeXtep Programming Language Organization! (Version 0.0.1 - Early Development)

This organization is the future home of the NeXtep programming language, an educational tool designed to foster algorithmic thinking in beginners. We are currently in the very early stages of development, laying the groundwork for a clear and straightforward path to understanding the fundamentals of computation.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to empower learners to grasp the core concepts of algorithms and programming logic through a simple and intuitive language. NeXtep will emphasize a step-by-step approach, mirroring the way computers execute instructions, making it ideal for those new to the world of programming.

## Repositories (Under Development)

As we are in the initial phase, the repositories for NeXtep are currently being set up. Here's a glimpse of what will be available soon:

* **nextep-lang-spec:** (Coming Soon) The official specification for the NeXtep language.
* **nextep-lang-interpreter:** (Coming Soon) The source code for the NeXtep interpreter.
* **nextep-lang-docs:** (Coming Soon) Documentation, tutorials, and examples for NeXtep.
* **nextep-lang-examples:** (Coming Soon) Example programs written in NeXtep.
* **nextep-lang-tools:** (Coming Soon) Additional tools related to NeXtep.
* **nextep-lang-community:** (Coming Soon) Resources for the NeXtep community.

**Please note that these repositories are currently empty or contain initial setup files.** We are actively working on the core components of the language.

## Getting Involved (Early Stage)

While NeXtep is still in its infancy, there are ways you can get involved early and help shape its development:

* **Follow this Organization:** Stay updated on our progress by watching this organization.
* **Share Your Thoughts:** We are open to discussing ideas and receiving feedback on the language design and features. You can use the "Issues" tab in this organization to share your thoughts.
* **Express Interest:** Let us know if you are interested in contributing to specific areas (e.g., interpreter development, documentation) once the repositories are more established.

## Contributing (Future)

Once the core components are in place, we will welcome contributions from the community. We anticipate the following areas for contribution:

* **Developing the Interpreter:** Helping build the engine that runs NeXtep code.
* **Writing Documentation and Tutorials:** Creating resources to help others learn NeXtep.
* **Creating Example Programs:** Showcasing how NeXtep can be used to solve problems.
* **Building Tools:** Developing helpful utilities for NeXtep users.

We will provide more detailed contribution guidelines as the project progresses.

## License

The NeXtep project will be licensed under MIT. The license will be specified in the `LICENSE` file within each repository once they are populated.
